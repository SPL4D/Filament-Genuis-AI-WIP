# GENERAL GUIDE (FALLBACK)
If a user request doesn't match the specific products above, follow these general principles but try to recommend a Filaform product first:
- PLA: Beginner, visual models.
- PETG: Functional, heat resistant (~75C).
- ABS/ASA: High temp (~100C), outdoor (ASA).
- TPU: Flexible.
- CF: High stiffness, requires hardened nozzle.
